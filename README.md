中文摘要
本⽂通过对中国的 HIV 感染者群体进⾏为期⼀年半的线上和线下⽥野调查， 试图
去揭⽰感染者⽣活中极其重要的抗病毒药物是如何流动、这种流动出现的原因和影响、
以及流动过程中“药物”和“医学知识”如何被理解和赋予独特意义。
研究发现，感染者的疾病叙述在开始抗病毒治疗以后很快转变成关于“抗病毒药物”
的叙述。这些叙述展⽰出药物副作⽤带给感染者的苦痛，并驱动着感染者寻求针对于
抗病毒药物以及抗病毒治疗的多元选择。⽽在个体层⾯的选择背后还存在着制度性问
题。 医疗体制改⾰实现了医疗卫⽣领域的市场化，然⽽市场逻辑却和公共卫⽣领域所
需要坚持的公共产品逻辑相⽭盾。这种⽭盾也表现在中国的 HIV 抗病毒治疗上。
“⾦钱”改变了 HIV/AIDS 的正统流⾏病学形态，它分层化了感染者群体及其对应
的抗病毒治疗，也影响了感染者对“有病没病”的判断以及对“治疗”的期待。 这⼀切又
催⽣了药物灰⾊市场的形成。 低价境外⾛私药物不断流⼊， ⽽国家免费药物又作为商
品被流出。 ⼤量感染者逐渐脱离权威的医疗卫⽣体系⽽选择“⾃主⽤药”， ⼤量免费药
物被当作阻断药物⽽滥⽤，进⽽可能威胁个体层⾯的抗病毒治疗以及更⼤范围的公共
健康。 “药”和相伴的“医学知识”不断被赋予附加意义⽽形成了⾃⼰的社会⽣活。 然⽽，
这种社会⽣活并不同于阿帕杜莱所说的“物的社会⽣活”，它并不⼀定是物本⾝的特性
变化，⽽可能是在流动过程中物被不同节点所理解以及被赋予附加值，即围绕着物并
通过物呈现的社会⽣活。

Abstract
In this article, through one-and-a-half-years online and onsite fieldworks to People Living
With HIV (PLWH), the author endeavors to show how Antiretroviral Drugs (ARVDs), the
significant things in PLWH’s lives, flow, why this flow happens, what possible consequences
this flow makes, and in such flow, how “Drugs” and “Medical Knowledge” are understood,
attached with special meanings.
The research suggests that the illness/disease narratives of PLWH quickly shift from the
narratives about HIV/AIDS to those about ARVDs after the start of Antiretroviral Treatment
(ART). Such narratives show PLWH’s sufferings from the side effects of AVRDs and impel
them to seek multiple choices about ARVDs and ARTs. Yet, behind the personal choices stand
institutional problems. The Healthcare Reform has achieved the marketization of medical and
health services, but its logic of market conflicts with the logic of public goods, which needs to
be insisted by public health services. Such conflict also influences the ARTs in China.
“Money” changes the conventional epidemiological profiles about HIV/AIDS. It stratifies
PLWH and their ARTs, and also influences PLWH’s conception of “Illness or not” and their
expectation of treatment. All these results then promote the formation of underground market
of ARDs. Cheap smuggled drugs keep flowing from the overseas to China, while free drugs
provided by Chinese governments flow out again as commodities. Amounts of PLWH
gradually step out of the authoritative medical and health system and choose “Self-Medication”;
plenty of free drugs are misused as post-exposure prophylactic drugs (PEP). These issues
possibly threaten individuals’ ARTs and even public health. “Drugs” and “Medical Knowledge”
accompanying drugs are constantly attached with additional meanings and then build their own
social lives. However, different from Appadurai’s “The Social Life of Things”, such social
life doesn’t necessarily mean changes of qualities of things themselves, but means that things
being understood and attached additional values by different knots through their flow, which
is the social life surrounding things and being presented by things.
Key Words: Antiretroviral Treatments, Antiretroviral Drugs, Drugs Flow,
